- Married women in the age group of 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka show a higher propensity to purchase products.
- Industries such as IT, Healthcare, and Aviation have a significant presence among the purchasing demographic.
- The most popular product categories among this demographic include Food, Clothing, and Electronics.

## Tools and Technologies Used
This analysis was conducted using the following tools and libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
